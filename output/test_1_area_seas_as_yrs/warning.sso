1 Season durations sum to <11.9, so SS assumes you are doing years as pseudo-seasons.
There can be only 1 season in this timestep and SS will ignore month input and assume all observation occur at middle of this pseudo-year
mortality, growth and movement rates are per annum, so will get multiplied by the duration of this timestep as they are used.
What gets reported as age is now age in timesteps; and input of age-specific M or K requires one entry per timestep
Similarly, output of age-specific quantities is in terms of number of timesteps, not real years
spawn_month and settlement_month in control file are best set to 1.0 when doing years as pseudo-seasons
2 fishing fleet: 1 surveytime read as: 1 normally is -1 for fishing fleet; can override for indiv. obs. using 1000+month
3 fishing fleet: 2 surveytime read as: 1 normally is -1 for fishing fleet; can override for indiv. obs. using 1000+month
4 fishing fleet: 3 surveytime read as: 1 normally is -1 for fishing fleet; can override for indiv. obs. using 1000+month
5 fishing fleet: 4 surveytime read as: 1 normally is -1 for fishing fleet; can override for indiv. obs. using 1000+month
6 fishing fleet: 5 surveytime read as: 1 normally is -1 for fishing fleet; can override for indiv. obs. using 1000+month
7 fishing fleet: 6 surveytime read as: 1 normally is -1 for fishing fleet; can override for indiv. obs. using 1000+month
8 fishing fleet: 7 surveytime read as: 1 normally is -1 for fishing fleet; can override for indiv. obs. using 1000+month
9 reset upper end of F_reporting_ages to be nages-2  
10 note: Std_yrmax=-1 in starter, so no variance output for forecast quantities after endyr+1 
11 NOTE: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.

12 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 3.20065e-10; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
13 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
