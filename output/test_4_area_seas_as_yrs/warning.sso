1 Season durations sum to <11.9, so SS assumes you are doing years as pseudo-seasons.
There can be only 1 season in this timestep and SS will ignore month input and assume all observation occur at middle of this pseudo-year
mortality, growth and movement rates are per annum, so will get multiplied by the duration of this timestep as they are used.
What gets reported as age is now age in timesteps; and input of age-specific M or K requires one entry per timestep
Similarly, output of age-specific quantities is in terms of number of timesteps, not real years
spawn_month and settlement_month in control file are best set to 1.0 when doing years as pseudo-seasons
