8 reset upper end of F_reporting_ages to be nages-2  
9 note: Std_yrmax=-1 in starter, so no variance output for forecast quantities after endyr+1 
10 NOTE: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
11 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 1.11788e-09; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
12 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
13 Forecast F capped by max possible F from control file: 2.9
14  Main recdev biasadj is >2 times ratio of rmse to sigmaR
15 Forecast F capped by max possible F from control file: 2.9
16 Reminder: Number of lamdas !=0.0 and !=1.0:  1
N warnings: 16
